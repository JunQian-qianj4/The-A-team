# The-A-team
The purpose of this project is to design an electric motorcycle capable of completing a quarter mile drag race in a competitive time. To make this possible, this project is divided into four main parts. The first part includes the mechanical design. This is composed of finding a usable powertrain based on EPA forces and calculating the torque and power requirements for the motorcycle to complete Â¼ mile as fast as possible. The second part is to pick the electric machine. The electric machine must be able to produce enough power and torque to drive the motorcycle. After finding an electric machine to drive the vehicle, a battery pack and inverter can be designed. To select and design a suitable battery type, it is related to the rated machine voltage, peak current, and required energy from the drive profile etc. last but not least, use PSIM Schematic to simulate the system, to verify the system efficiency and performance.
